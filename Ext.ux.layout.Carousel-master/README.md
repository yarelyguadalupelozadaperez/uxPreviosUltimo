Ext.ux.layout.Carousel
======================

A Sencha workspace demonstrating a custom "3D Carousel" layout in both Ext JS and Sencha Touch

### Running the examples

This is a Sencha workspace, with two example apps. To keep the GitHub repo small, I excluded the following directories (see my .gitignore):

  - ~/ext (Ext JS 5.0.x)
  - ~/touch (Sencha Touch 2.3.x)

You'll have to add those on your own or edit the sample apps' framework locations to run.

You'll also have to run `sencha app build` inside each sample app in order to have the SASS from `Ext.ux.layout.Carousel` included in the generated CSS.

### THIS IS A TECH DEMO

While I happen to think this custom "3D Carousel" is cool, I haven't tested it thoroughly and I make no claims that it's solid.

My advice: **DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION**.
